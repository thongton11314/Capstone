# Capstone
## Overview
  We implement an application that embraces multiple Computer Science concepts which include but are not limited to: Cloud Computing, Web Application,  Database, Search Engines,     APIs, front-end, back-end, and more to create an application that serves as a notifier on discounts or reduced prices on grocery item(s). 

  For example, if I want to buy some Fuji apples at Walmart for a reduced price, I can use this application to notify me whenever the apples I want are on sale. This application     would help the user save extra money by finding the best grocery prices.
